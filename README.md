# FACE-MASK-DOOR-UNLOCKING-SYSTEM
We have developed and trained our model in Google Colab using Cascade classifier  in such a way that it detects whether the person is wearing the mask or not and the data is sent to TinkerCad using Thing Speak where the door unlocking system is developed using Arduino Uno and the door will be unlocked only if the person is wearing the mask.
